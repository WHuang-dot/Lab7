This is the source code for a simple website I created with html and css. There is not a lot of content in it. 
My main obejctive for this small project was to learn how to host a website using AWS's S3 feature.
instead of making a programmer portfolio, I took this opportunity to learn how to host a website because I felt like I don't have many project to organize a portfolio.
I hosted this website with the custom domain http://wonghmail.com/ I purchased a while ago for email forwarding using AWS.
